# **HUGE** UPDATE INCOMMING!
We want you to be a part in our **HUGE** update introducing the WinTweaks11 Installer! This installer makes you able to download and install this Tweakpack and many others in just a couple clicks, making it easier than ever to use WinTweaks11's TweakPacks. 
But that is not everything! We are going to use 5 different types off WLaM, making you able to choose your own type (skilled level) TweakPack. With each type we give you different options, for example:

   > Want to install the normal version of WLaM?   -> Default_Mode
   > want a Portable version, for your school laptop?   -> Basic_Mode
   > or do you just want to download the files?   -> Minimal_Mode
   > or want to go the other way, and add your own features?   -> Advanced_Mode / Developer_mode

check "WLaM Generation + Version + Serial log" for extra information about serial_keys, generations, versions and types.

We are going to put media files here, so you can see how it look.

### **Open source?!**
Yes we are in fact an open source but in a different way because we want to know where our files end up, So we made it that people need to mail there modified TweaksPack to wintweaks11@gmail.com and where they want to publish the file. 

Then we send an Mail to verify the usage (if we don't accept it you need to delete the file from the publish location). And upload your modified TweakPack(if it's a safe file!?) to our Github page where you can download it. 

### **Are all programs we use open source?**

Sometimes we need to use for example programs that aren't open source when this occurs you will be warned about this with the program that isn't open source! Because we are open source we appreciated it when people give us feedback about our projects! 
So Please Leave a message when the project isn't working correctly! and send your feedback so we can make this project better for you! the consumer. 
In the future we will provide versions made with feedback from the community in our mind.
