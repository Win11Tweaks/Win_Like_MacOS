## Descriptions: 
In this Log you are able to find all the different versions and generations off WLaM (Windows Like a Mac), with their available Serial Keys. It also explains why the names and serials of the TweakPacks are like this. 

### You can install 5 different types of this TweakPack, each with their different purposes:

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

*Download*
	
	->	Minimal_Mode; 
			No @Admin permission needed, Only downloads certain non-system-applications files onto the users desktop. (so only none-admin-permissions files are downloaded )

*Portable*
	
	->	Basic_Mode; 
			No @Admin permission needed, and installs the files and software. It has less features, but is more capable as a portable option. 

*User Instalation & Use*
	
	->	Default_Mode;
			Requires @Admin permissions to install the full TweakPack and use all it's features.

*Customize the Default_Mode*
	
	->	Advanced_Mode;
			Requires @Admin permissions to recover/reinstall/modify/uninstall the Default_Mode instralation, **CAUTION: This is more like a add-on, and requires the Default_Mode to be installed first!**

*developer*
	
	->	Developer_Mode; 
			Requires @Admin permissions, and allows you to add your own functions, features, aplications, code, and more. Simply what a developer does. **CAUTION: This is more like a add-on, and requires the Default_Mode OR Basic_Mode OR Minimal_Mode to be installed first!**

### Serial_keys, how are they taught out and what is their purpose:

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Serial Keys are ALWAYS **FREE**, and are displayed behind the sort off Release you want to install, for example: 

	-> Version_0.000.01_ALFA [serial_key=#-#-##--#-##-##] 

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### This layout means:

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	
*for the versions*

	-> "Version" "_" @Generation(#) "." @Version(#-##) "." @Release(##) 
 
*for the serial keys*

	-> @Generation(#) "-" @Version(#-##) "- -" @Sort(#) "-" @Type(#) @Admin(#) "-" @Release(##)
